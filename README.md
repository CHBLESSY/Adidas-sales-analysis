       - Womenâ€™s Athletic Footwear has the lowest sales ($107M), indicating a need for improved marketing strategies.
       - The West region leads in sales (30%), while the Midwest has the lowest contribution (5.09%).
       - West Gear, Foot Locker, and Sports Direct are the top-performing retailers, generating the highest revenue.
       - Sales peak in July and August, while March records the lowest sales, highlighting seasonal demand fluctuations.
       - E-commerce platforms like Amazon and Walmart have relatively lower sales, suggesting an opportunity for digital expansion.
       - The average margin is 42%, indicating a strong profitability structure for Adidas.
   
  ## Conclusion
     To boost sales and sustain growth, Adidas should enhance marketing efforts during low-sales months like March and capitalize on peak demand in mid-year. Expanding in low-performing regions like the Midwest and strengthening Womenâ€™s Athletic Footwear marketing can drive further revenue. Additionally, improving e-commerce presence on Amazon and Walmart and partnering with top retailers like West Gear and Foot Locker will optimize sales channels. By implementing these strategies, Adidas can maximize revenue, expand market reach, and maintain a strong competitive edge. ðŸš€
